# Java-FirstSpringBootCRUD

This is my first version of a CRUD application using Spring Boot and Maven. Users can register a unique username, an age, and a unique email. The email can only be registered if it follows the format ("%@%.com"). Each user is assigned an ID starting from 1.

If a username or email is deleted, a new registered user can reuse that username or email.
